# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Logistic Regression

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using **Logistic Regression**. It is one of the most popular beginner projects in machine learning and covers data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is available from [Kaggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

### Features include:
- `Pclass` (Passenger class)
- `Sex` (Gender)
- `Age`
- `SibSp` (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- `Parch` (Number of parents/children aboard)
- `Fare`
- `Embarked` (Port of embarkation)

---

## 🧠 Model

The model used: **Logistic Regression**

### Why Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is ideal for binary classification tasks like predicting whether a passenger survived (`1`) or not (`0`).This repository contains a simple implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification using Python. The project demonstrates how logistic regression works and can be used as a base for learning or further development.
